        "This notebook demonstrates a **CrewAI Flow** that dynamically routes content creation tasks to specialized crew of agents based on user input. This workflow showcases CrewAI's advanced Flow architecture with **state persistence**, **event-driven routing**, and **multi-crew orchestration**.\n",

        "- **Flow Architecture**: Event-driven workflows with `@start`, `@router`, and `@listen` decorators\n",
        "- **State Management**: Persistent state across workflow execution with `@persist`\n",
        "- **Dynamic Routing**: Intelligent crew selection based on content type\n",
        "- **Multi-Crew Orchestration**: Coordinating specialized teams for different content formats\n",

        "### 🌊 Flow Steps:\n",
        "1. **Input Collection**: Gather URL and desired content type from user\n",
        "2. **Dynamic Routing**: Route to appropriate specialized crew based on content type\n",
        "3. **Content Processing**: Execute specialized content creation with dedicated crews\n",
        "4. **Output Finalization**: Return polished, ready-to-use content"
